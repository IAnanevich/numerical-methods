# Laboratory work on numerical methods in physics

### First Lab: 
Solution of ODEs by explicit, implicit and improved Euler's methods and Gear's methods of the 1st, 2nd and 4th orders.

### Second Lab:
ODE solution by the 2nd order Gear method and the 2nd order Adams-Bashforth-Multon methods.

### Third Lab:
Solution of partial differential equations of parabolic type.
To solve the heat conduction equation 1D, the following were applied:
- explicit schema
- implicit scheme
- Richardson's scheme
- scheme of Dufort and Frankel
- Crank-Nicholson scheme
An explicit scheme was used to solve the 2D heat conduction equation. The convection-diffusion equation was also solved by explicit and implicit schemes.

### Fourth Lab:
Solution of partial differential equations of hyperolic type.
To solve the 1D convection equation, the following were applied:
- explicit schema
- explicit Lax-Wendroff scheme
- Richtmyer scheme (two-step method of the Lax-Wendroff type)
- Scheme of Dufort and Frankel McCormack (predictor-corrective scheme of the Lax-Wendroff type)
- first order upstream method
- second order upstream method

### Fifth Lab:
Solving Fredholm integral equations by the quadrature method with 3 and 10 nodes, using:
- trapezoidal formula
- by the Gauss formula
